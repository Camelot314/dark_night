# Dark Night Extension

Firefox extension.
<br>
The goal is change all websites to dark mode when enabled.

> **Note**
> <br>
> If the website has a darkmode feature it will not be enabled. The extention just changes the background color of the html.

This was made to experiment and learn some `javascript`
